                <p>HE GREAT, DESPERATE, ONE-SIDED BATTLES OF HISTORY - THE ALAMO, RORKE'S DRIFT, IWO JIMA - ARE QUICKLY DRAWN
                    into myth. And it is through film, that most modern of myth-making mediums, that the oldest
                    heroic battle of all, that of a handful of Spartans against the Persian army at Thermopylae,
                    has been turned into 300, the movie that opened this weekend.</p>

                <p>As in Roberto Rodriguez’s Sin City, director Zack Snyder has created a homage
                    to Frank Miller’s original graphic novel, right down to<div class="pic2">
            <img src="images1/comparison.jpg"/>
        </div> the brushstrokes of blood.
                    Visually, the film is a wonder: it continues and improves upon the respectful treatment
                    that graphic novels have achieved in film in the last decade (starting with X-Men),
                    using computer graphics seamlessly, at the level of art. This is where the technology should be:
                    not to create clean, glittering spaceships in the darkness of space, but to achieve a majesty
                    and field of vision that would otherwise be impossible, or ruinously expensive, to film,
                    a way of transporting art from the printed page to celluloid honestly and compellingly.

            <p>From the beginning, the Spartan Dilio narrates the birth, training, and ascension
                of King Leonidas, the leader who is fated to lead his men into the Hot Gates.
                The film does not shirk from showing us the Spartans as flawed, tragic heroes:
                prideful, brutal and cold, the Spartan warriors are callous killing machines,
                glorying in battle and death, despising weakness and pity. It is only on the battlefield
                that their emotional true selves, their regrets and loves, visibly flicker to the surface
                before being snuffed out by death.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="par4">
            <p>And it is in death – death in battle – that the Spartans seek their glory.
                Indeed, it is their wolfish eagerness for it, the sheer exuberance they take
                in expressing every sinew, every muscle, every skill they have in violent carnage,
                that is the hallmark of the movie, both horrifying and exhilarating. The editing,
                stunt and camera work are a marvel, soaking the screen in testosterone, the battle
                scenes balletic bloodletting filmed in proportions befitting Greek heroes
                (probably assisted by the fact that I saw the film in an IMAX theatre). </p>
