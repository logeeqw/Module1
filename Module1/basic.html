<h1>Interneting Is Easy</h1>
<p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>
<h2>Headings</h2>
<p> Headings are titles you can see. Six levels of headings. </p>

<h2>Lists</h2>
<p>How to make unordered lists</p>
<ul>
    <il>Use "ul" element to start unordered list</il>
    <li>"li" elements are used for individual items </li>
    <li> They don't need to be in a special order</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>

<ol>
    <li>"ol" element wraps everything</li>
    <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
    <li>Also note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
    <li>You should be noticing things is this precise order, because this is
        an ordered list</li>
</ol>
<h2>Inline elements</h2>
<p><em> Sometimes</em> you need to draw attention to a word or phrase </p>
<p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance
    of a word or phrase.</p>


<p>Thanks for reading! Interneting should be getting easier now.</p>
