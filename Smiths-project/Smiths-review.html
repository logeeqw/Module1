       <p>Review by Dudley Storey</p>
        <br>
    </div>

    <div class="p1">
        <p>While perhaps best remembered as the movie in which Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt became
            star-crossed lovers,<em>Mr. & Mrs. Smith</em>  deserves more attention than your typical A-list
            action movie. In particular, the film’s trenchant critique of suburbia, marriage, and
            the lies we tell each other every day make it a relevant, contemporary movie. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="p2">
        <br>
        <p>As the film is now almost 10 years old, I will be revealing some mild spoilers in this review,
            but it should not be enough to disturb enjoyment of the movie.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="h2">
        <br>
        <h2>A Slow Death In Suburbia</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="p3">
        <br>
        <p>The very first scene of the movie with John (Pitt) and Jane (Jolie) Smith features them in the
            modern suburban torture chamber: therapy in the office of a marriage counselor. While denying
            that they need any kind of help (“Just a maintenance checkup” John claims) it is obvious that
            they are deeply uncomfortable in each other’s presence, a rawness helped by the fact that this
            was the first scene shot in the film.<a href="#*" class="link">*</a> </p>
    </div>

    <div class="p4">
        <br>
        <p>As told in flashback, the couple originally met under dramatic and emotionally heightened
            circumstances in Panama, framing both their attraction and the cause of their self-destruction.
            Each is an assassin for a rival company, but instinctively uses their cover as a civilian
            contractor from the moment they meet, successfully fooling each other for the first six years
            of their relationship. It is this same deceit that threatens the end of their marriage.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="p5">
        <br>
        <p>In this way the film is very similar to<em>True Lies</em> , the action-comedy film directed 10 years
            earlier by James Cameron. However, in that film the deceit was almost entirely one-sided,
            the manipulation significantly more disturbing, and (being a Cameron- Schwarzenegger film)
            focused much more on spectacle.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="p6">
        <br>
        <p>While seeing each other as equals, it quickly becomes apparent that John and Jane are very
            different people. Jane is reserved, precise, analytical, poised; her husband is rough-and-tumble,
            raw and improvisational. Every remaining bit of their energy is devoted to maintaining a successful
            cover: a fine house, the latest model cars. But it is only in danger and risk that they come alive:
            life in suburbia is boredom and ennui, and it’s clear that they can’t wait to escape the prison
            they have built for themselves each day.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="h3">
        <br>
        <h2>Marching Orders</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="p7">
        <br>
        <p>When their respective employers discover who they work for, John and Jane are set to kill each
            other. While these first attempts fail, the seething resentment of both wife and husband fuels
            a series of mounting revenge attacks. Their destruction comes almost gleeful – you can see them
            actually <em> enjoying</em> themselves in competition with each other – and ultimately frees them
            from the web of lies they have spun.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="p8">
        <br>
        <p>Having failed in eliminating their rival, the previously inimical companies contracting
            John and Jane temporarily put aside their differences to end the problem of the Smiths,
            driving them closer together in survival instinct. The last third of the movie is the fight
            of John and Jane against the joined forces of their companies, culminating in a final showdown
            reminiscent of the climax in <em>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</em> .</p>

        <br>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="p9">
        <br>
        <p>While it is not without its faults (in particular Vincent Vaughn’s misogynistic,
            eternally frustrated character has become all too familiar in too many movies),
            Mr. & Mrs. Smith also has a significant share of charm. The chemistry between Pitt
            and Jolie is natural and unfeigned, and the film mixes great action sequences with
            a barded critique of modern suburban life, and it remains, on the whole,
            one of my favorite films.</p>

        <br>
        <p><span id="*">*</span>Sadly, the rest of the film was not shot chronologically: I was feel that doing so imparts
            an extra emotional verisimilitude to an actor’s performance, as they can express the emotional
            arc of their character in the same sequence that the audience experiences it.</p>
